# Python Portfolio – Supply Chain & Operations

This repository shows how I apply **Python** to real-world problems in **Supply Chain / Operations**.

The focus is not only technical, but also **business-oriented**:
KPIs, inventory decisions and report automation to support management.

## Use cases covered
- 📊 **OTIF KPI (On Time In Full)** by customer and period
- 📦 **Inventory management**: ABC classification, safety stock and reorder point (ROP)
- ⚙️ **Report automation**: consolidation of daily files into a weekly Excel report

All data used is **dummy/demo**, created only to showcase methodology and logic.
